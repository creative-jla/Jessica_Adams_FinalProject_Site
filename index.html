      <div class="text-block">This map was created for me to learn more about my father, Chris Adams. He joined the Navy in 1984 and retired as Senior Chief in 2004. All of the yellow circles are places he has visited while being in the service. When hovering over the circles, you will see the location, what my father thought of the area, and when he was there (if the information is available). Certain circles will be bigger to show how many people from my family of three have been in that area. These circles will include what my mother, Teresa, and I thought about the location and what year it was when we first visited the area. The blue circles are places we lived as a family while my dad was enlisted in the Navy. Scroll down to begin.</div>
